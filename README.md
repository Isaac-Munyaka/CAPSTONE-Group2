The employment sector is continuously evolving, with job seekers and employers facing numerous challenges. 
Job seekers often struggle to find suitable job opportunities that match their skills and preferences, while employers find it difficult to attract qualified candidates for their job postings. 
With the advent of advanced data analytics and machine learning, there is an opportunity to enhance the job matching process, 
making it more efficient and effective for both parties.

## Introduction
In today's competitive job market, the ability to efficiently match job seekers with relevant job opportunities is crucial. 
Leveraging data from job postings and job seeker profiles, machine learning models can significantly improve the job search experience and the quality of job applications received by employers.
This proposal outlines a plan to develop two machine learning models: 
one for optimizing job recommendations for job seekers and another for predicting the likelihood of job postings receiving a high or low number of applications.


## Business Understanding
For job seekers, finding the right job that matches their skills, preferences, and career aspirations is a challenging task. 
Similarly, employers face difficulties in creating job postings that attract the right candidates.
By addressing these challenges through advanced machine learning models, we can create a more efficient job market, benefiting both job seekers and employers.

## Problem Statement
Despite the vast amount of job postings available online, job seekers often find it challenging to identify the most relevant opportunities.
Conversely, employers struggle to understand what factors contribute to the attractiveness of their job postings, leading to a mismatch between job offers and applications. This proposal aims to solve these issues by:
1.	Providing personalized job recommendations to job seekers to match them with the most suitable job postings.
2.	Developing a machine learning model that predicts whether a job posting will receive a high or low number of applications, helping employers improve their job postings.

## Objectives
1.***Optimize Job Recommendations***: Provide personalized job recommendations to job seekers to match them with the most suitable job postings.

2.***Predict Candidate Interest***: Develop a machine learning model to predict whether a job posting will receive a high or low number of applications, enabling companies to understand which factors attract candidates the most and improve their job postings.


## Target Audience
***Job Seekers***: Individuals seeking suitable job opportunities and career growth.

***Employers***: Companies looking to recruit qualified candidates for job openings.

***Recruitment Agencies***: Agencies that assist job seekers and employers in the recruitment process.


## SUCCESS METRICS
Application Rate: Percentage of job postings receiving applications.

Qualified Application Rate: Percentage of applications meeting job requirements.

Precision: Measure the proportion of recommended jobs that are relevant to the job seeker's input skills.

Recall: Measure the proportion of relevant jobs that are successfully recommended to the job seeker.

F1 Score: Balance precision and recall to provide a single metric that evaluates the model's performance.

Accuracy 90%: Measure the overall correctness of the model in predicting application likelihood

## Feature Importance
Views: The high importance score suggests
that this feature has a strong predictive
power in the model.
Description: The length or quality of the
job description is the second most
important feature.
Days_since_listed: This feature might help
in understanding the freshness of the job
posting and its attractiveness over time.
average_salary: The average salary offered
by the job posting has some impact on the
prediction.
formatted_experience_level: Suggests
that while the experience level is a factor, it
may not a strong predictor of the number of
applications.
work_type: The type of work (e.g., full-time,
part-time, remote) also has minimal
importance in the model is a factor but
does not significantly influence the
prediction.

## Conclusion
Random Forest perfomed better based on Test accuracy and F1 Score

## Recommender Models

1.Job Recommendations Based on Description: Summary: The system recommends jobs
based on similarity to the input job description. For instance, a description like "certified
customer care agent" led to recommendations in related fields such as sales and insurance.
2.Job Recommendations Based on Job ID (KNN Model) Using job features like views,
applies, and average_salary, the KNN model provided recommendations based on the
similarity of job attributes. The output showed similar jobs based on these features.
3.Job Recommendations Based on Title Filter: Recommendations based on a keyword
filter (e.g., "engineer") returned jobs with titles containing the keyword, like "full stack
engineer" and "software engineer intern.â€œ
4.Job Recommendations Based on Average Distance (KNN Results): The KNN model
returned jobs with very low average distances, indicating high similarity to the input job ID.
The results were very similar in terms of job attributes.
5.Job Recommendations Based on Input Job Title (General System): The system provided
recommendations based on the job title input, returning jobs with similar titles. For
example, inputting "nurse" resulted in various nursing-related job recommendations.

## System Recommendations

1. Boost Job Visibility: Encourage recruiters to
increase job views through strategic promotion and
SEO, ensuring postings reach a wider audience.
2. Enhance Job Descriptions: Advise recruiters to
craft detailed, compelling job descriptions to attract
top talent.
3. Promote Fresh Listings: Encourage recruiters to
emphasize new job postings to capitalize on their
initial attractiveness and draw immediate attention.
